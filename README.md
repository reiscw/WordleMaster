# WordleMaster
A tool which allows the user to quickly identify potential solutions when playing Wordle.

You will need to supply a file named "words.txt" that contains a list of five letter candidate words, one-per-line.  When Wordle first became popular, before its acquisition by <I>The New York Times</I>, various individuals obtained the list of candidate words directly from the creator's implementation. As I am not sure of the copyright status of that list of words, I am not providing it. You should be able to find suitable lists online.

Please note that the GUI elements have been tested most extensively on macOS (v12.4) but I have also used the application on Windows and Linux and it seems to work well. The buildWordle script can be used to create a JAR file (you will still need the words.txt file in the same directory).
